# Getting Started with Simple React App using JSON server

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is Simple react app using JSON server from the same from typecode (https://github.com/typicode/json-server). 
 It's making a request to add a user an email and then if we click or we go to a post, we're going to load, of course, the data about the posts, an image which is a random image

## Setup projects to your local

git clone https://github.com/jonomk07/thedailynews.git

npm install 

do not forget to install the latest json server from the typecode repository 
what typecode do , they give you like an install, like a library you can install on your computer and 
you can create a server, an API server in less than 30 seconds  and this is actually real.

$ npm install -g json-server

json-server --watch db.json --port 3004

In case you come accrose some errors regading libraries  you will need tp install :

Axios is a promise based HTTP client for the browser and Node. js. Axios makes it easy to send asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints and perform CRUD operations. It can be used in plain JavaScript or with a library such as Vue or React

npm install --save axios react-bootstrap react-router-bootstrap bootstrap
npm install --save react-redux redux redux-promise react-router-dom react-toastify

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
